This was done by myself and Reagan Hennen. This was our final project for CS200 or Data Structures and Algorithms 1. This was a tile based game where a character traverses through
locations in order to reach a certain end goal. It was done in java and incorporates a lot of maps and is a depth first search algorithm. In order to run this game yourself is to unzip the file, 
then go into the main folder and look for the driver java file and run it in any java program (we used Dr. Java). It is a directed graph with 10 different locations. The game also allows you
to save and continue on later.
